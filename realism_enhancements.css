/*
 * REALISM ENHANCEMENTS FOR GIFT BOX
 * This file adds border-radius and box-shadow for a more realistic look.
 */

/* 1. Target the Main Gift Box and Lid */
/* Assuming the main container for the box is one of these selectors. */
.gift, 
.box-body {
  /* Softens the main corners for a less "digitally sharp" look */
  border-radius: 8px; 
  
  /* Adds a subtle shadow for depth, making it look lifted and realistic */
  box-shadow: 0 8px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}

/* 2. Target the Lid (if it's a separate element) */
/* Assuming the lid has a selector like .box-lid or .lid */
.box-lid,
.box-top {
  /* Round the corners of the lid, but perhaps slightly less than the body */
  border-radius: 6px; 
}

/* 3. Target the Ribbon and Bow */
/* Ribbons should also have a tiny bit of roundness to look less like sharp rectangles. */
.ribbon, 
.bow-part {
  /* A very small radius to suggest a fabric-like softness */
  border-radius: 2px;
}

/* --- Optional Enhancements for More Realism --- */

/* If you have a hover effect, make the lift more pronounced */
.gift:hover, 
.box-body:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 12px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
  transform: translateY(-2px); /* Lifts the box slightly on hover */
  transition: all 0.3s ease-out; /* Smooth transition for the effect */
